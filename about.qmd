Hi, I am Mauricio. I am an Researcher with over **9 years of experience** working with mathematical models. For that that wished to turn into a Data Scientist. Why? I have a passion for modelling and I also want that the models I build are useful. I think then that Machine Learning models are the perfect tool to answer that wish?
