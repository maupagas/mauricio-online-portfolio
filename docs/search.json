The VIP guests? Tiny organisms that break down waste, turning it into something less gross. But how do they do it? And which pathways lead to the best dance moves (read: ATP production)?\nIn a recent study, scientists put on their lab coats and hit the microbial dance floor. Their mission: to figure out which biochemical pathways yield the most ATP (the cellular energy currency) during propionate oxidation. Let’s break it down:\nThe Pathway Shuffle: Microbes have options. Different pathways involve various metabolites, electron carriers, and ATP steps. Picture a dance-off: Some pathways moonwalk, while others cha-cha with protons (or their equivalents). The Feasibility Check: To get past the bouncer (i.e., feasibility evaluation), a pathway must meet two criteria: All reaction steps must have nonpositive Gibbs energy changes (no energy vampires allowed!). Metabolite concentrations must stay within a physiological range (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻² M). The ATP Champions: Under optimal conditions, the Smithella pathway struts its stuff, yielding the most ATP. The methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) pathways? They’re like backup dancers—only grooving with pyruvate in a cyclical routine. The Methane Afterparty: In methanogenic environments (think swamps), other pathways take the spotlight. Lactate and hydroxypropionyl-CoA pathways? They’re the headliners, belting out ATP hits. Electron Transfer Tango: How do microbes exchange electrons? Some flirt with dissolved hydrogen via the Smithella pathway. Others? They salsa with formate or engage in direct electron transfer (fancy footwork!)."

    "text": "In this report, an analysis of the data to be used to estimate epidemiological parameters for the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages of interest (e.g.: BA.1, B.1.629, etc.) is presented. Firstly, the data is cleaned to ensure that no duplicates, and proper lineages are used. Then, the data analysis is conducted. In particular, the analysis is focused on the identification of potential biases in the data as it compares people who were sequenced against people who were not sequenced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDue to confidentiality issues, the results have been masked in this document accordingly.\nThe data displayed in the figures, tables and text are shown for illustrative purposes and do not reflect real numbers.\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling strategy followed in the United Arab Emirates from January 1st, 2022 comprised the sequencing of samples from individuals that belonged to one of the following groups:\n\nAll people in ICU/HDU and/or deceased.\nAll people who entered through a port of entry and had a positive PCR.\nThe rest of the infected people were sequenced based on a random sample proportionally to the number of positives reported by each lab on a weekly basis.\n\nSampling prior to the stated day needs to be double-checked for proper interpretation.\nThe sampling strategy described follows WHO recommendation.

This field will be used to estimate the population properties of those that were randomly sequenced. In particular, checking the randomness assumption is a goal of the work presented in this document. (Group 3)\nTableau_ICU_Status: Label if the patient is ICU/HDU or dead. This field will be used to label the patients as HDU/ICU pr dead as reason per sequencing. All patients labeled in this field were sequenced. (Group 1)\nTableau_Travel_Country_Name: Travel history of the positive patient in the last XX days. This field will be used to label those patients who tested positive and had a travel history according to the IDN and PRP databases. (Group 2)\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we need to clean the data to ensure that the data is of a good enough quality and no double-counting occurs. In particular we are going to focus on three aspects:\n\nRe-code lineage into relevant variants. In particular:\na. Rename AY.XX into parent lineage Delta B.1.659.2.\nb. Rename all BA.X.X into the parent lineage BA.X (e.g. BA.1.1 is renamed as BA.1).\nc. Rename variant B.1.1.529 as BA.1 as per this description.\nFix records in which age is not defined by retrieving the age from the year of birth from the Emirates ID.\n\n\nRemove invalid records, namely:\na. EIDs that are invalid and do not correspond to any record (5145 records).\nb. Records with lineage labeled as Jul 25 2022 12:00AM (2033 records).\nc. Records with a CollectionDateTime before February 1st, 2020 (6 records).\nRemove duplicate IDs covering the same infection case are present in the database (e.g. two EIDs for the same date labeled the lineage as BA.2 and BA.2.1).\nSelect for the patients sequenced only those whose lineage sequenced have at least more than 500 records.\nCheck also how many records labeled as non-sequenced have a lab assigned according to the dashboard data from ADPHC.\n\nOnce the data is cleaned, we can summarize the number of cases per variant recorded and compare it to the values published by ADPHC.\n\n\nLineages in the dataset appear with multiple names. Some of those lineages were recorded with multiple names. In the original dataset there are 1000 different variants labeled. Some of the reasons for so many sublineages defined registered were\n\nAll sublineages were registered (e.g.: BA.2.40, BA.2.75)\nThe mutation of the sublineage was labeled registered (e.g.: AY.17 (S:D1118Y))\n\nSome sublineages contain a certain description (e.g. BA.2 (Recombinant?))\nSome sublineages are double coded (e.g.: “Delta/B.1.617.2”)\nSome sublineages were wrongly labeled (e.g.: ~2000 records with “Jul 25 2022 12:00AM” as lineage)\n\nTherefore, an aggregation criteria needs to be defined. For the purposes of this report, the following criteria was used:\n\nDescription of mutations were removed (e.g. AY.17 (S:D1118Y) becomes AY.17)\nAll variants were re-defined to their main sub-lineages (e.g.: AY.17 or AY.103 were redefined as B.1.617.2).\nDouble labeling was defined as per the lineage name (e.g.:Delta/B.1.617.2 was coded as B.1.617.2).\nVariant B.1.1.529 was renamed as BA.1.\nAll records with lineage labeled as “Jul 25 2022 12:00AM” were removed.\n\nAfter the re-coding of the lineages in the databases, the number of records for each lineage (for those lineages that contained more than 500 records) is shown in Figure @ref(fig:check-recoded-lineages). It is important to note that this distribution is done with the raw data before removing duplicates in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of records per lineage before removal of duplicates.\n\n\n\n\nOnce lineages have been re-coded and the data cleaned from invalid records, we can move into the removal of duplicates.\n\n\n\nAfter recoding lineages and fixing the records that were considered as invalid, the next step consists of cleaning the data by removing all the duplicates.\nFirstly, We check the number of duplicate IDs appearing in the database. This is shown in ?@tbl-duplicate-ids-check or Table @ref(tab:duplicate-ids-check):\n\n\n\n\nNumber of records per ID number of the 10 most repeated records in the database.\n\n\nPseudoID\n# records\n\n\n\n\n{6BFEAEC8-A945-48B5-B87B-59E8E6F64435}\n340\n\n\n{20A622C3-06CB-4E9D-86E0-0632490450B6}\n144\n\n\n{37D050C7-4927-4AC6-B43E-6631A462EC3D}\n140\n\n\n{B3BA3F02-9D09-42A4-AF4F-8DEC36CE5007}\n140\n\n\n{080D687A-A6E6-4BC1-9098-EE740BEE0EC9}\n120\n\n\n{492A371D-3629-455E-9FE2-8760C6B1783F}\n120\n\n\n{74E26468-4BF9-4503-BAE4-785942560BED}\n120\n\n\n{9DC90E03-1C5A-40F0-8330-3BDD7DE5D57D}\n120\n\n\n{C9EEA6BA-0D32-4BC1-9E4E-5A4E550689DE}\n120\n\n\n{F80A583E-AC85-4C45-9F75-823AD0592E87}\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see in the summary table, there are many patients that are repeated in the records (as many as 340 times).\nFor example, we can see the different labels for a given patient in Table @ref(tab:patient-multiple-records):\n\n\n\n\nDifferent records for the same infection(s) for patient with PseudoID\n\n\nCollectionDateTime\nNationality\nAge\nLineage.Short\nTableau_Travel_Country_Name\nTableau_ICU_Status\nPerforming.Facility\nSequenced\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\nBA.1\nSERBIA\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\nUNKNOWN\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-28 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n31\n\nUnknown\n\n\n0\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\nBA.5\nUNKNOWN\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\nBA.5\nUNKNOWN\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore it looks like many patients are registered as repeated cases for the same infection episode.

The following steps were followed to fix this issue with duplicate EIDs:\n\nIdentify each episode of infection within 30 days as one infection episode.\nDefine Collection Date as the first date in which the sample of the infected individual was collected\nFill the nationality field with the record that contains a nationality\nFill the lineage field with the first record of the patient that contains a proper lineage\nCreate a Travel.Country field in which to register the country name (if available) for the given ID.\nCreate a Travel.History field in which to register the labels Yes/No/Unknown for the given ID.\nCreate a Traveled field with Yes/No if there is a valid field in Travel.Country or Travel.History (e.g. patient with empty field in Travel.History but with Travel.Country label). This means that those patients with travel history unknown and/or travel country name as unknown were considered as non-travelers.\nRegister the first non-empty field for Tableau_ICU_Status.\nRegister the first non-empty field for Performing Facility for sequenced patients (when available).\n\nAfter cleaning the data, we can check how many times a person is repeated in Table @ref(tab:duplicate-ids-cleaned-check).\n\n\n\n\nNumber of records per ID number of the 10 most repeated records in the database.\n\n\nPseudoID\n# records\n\n\n\n\n{92E11469-6664-4C51-B14B-45C1844C6761}\n6\n\n\n{53E1C60B-BDD6-4A59-85D4-3152AF8FE89F}\n5\n\n\n{763E6F05-FA36-4203-B78B-58DB686BEC1E}\n5\n\n\n{8E907F96-5A60-4B8C-97BD-D22B0B7DFBDE}\n5\n\n\n{A5E35727-E930-44CB-A734-10429FAAB9E1}\n5\n\n\n{CDD7B77C-D1AC-43A8-B257-D1EEF6AC6689}\n5\n\n\n{F719CB95-F15C-4EED-8666-46D2030BA2CE}\n5\n\n\n{0461EE2E-5C5A-4188-9821-F625C174D335}\n4\n\n\n{0506B233-B0B9-4E64-B7BC-F61A7396923C}\n4\n\n\n{112090DF-F669-41D9-BB11-381F86D64F6C}\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we can check also if the record of the patient shown in Table @ref(tab:patient-multiple-records) has become the expected record in Table @ref(tab:patient-multiple-records-cleaned):\n\n\n\n\nDifferent records for the same infection(s) for patient with PseudoID\n\n\nCollection.Date\nNationality\nAge\nLineage\nTravel.History\nTableau.ICU.Status\nPerforming.Facility\nSequenced\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-25\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.1\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n1\n\n\n2022-06-09\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\nYes\nOthers\nG42 Laboratory\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of lineages after the removal of duplicate records is shown in Figure @ref(fig:remove-duplicate-records-plot):\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of people sequenced per variant after data cleaning.

This show in Figure @ref(fig:group-by-age-density):\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity distribution of positive cases for sequenced and non-sequenced people\n\n\n\n\nWe can see also the total count for sequenced and non-sequenced groups in Figure @ref(fig:group-by-age-histogram):\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram fo the distribution of positive cases for sequenced and non-sequenced people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can break down the totals shown in Figure @ref(fig:distribution-by-reason-seq) into the age distribution by reason for sequencing:\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity distribution of positive cases per reason of sequencing for sequenced and non-sequenced people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the distribution of the samples based on their nationality in Figure @ref(fig:distribution-by-nationality):\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the high number of labels however, it is difficult to define a significant difference for nationality regarding the samples for the sequenced and non-sequenced people.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect that could be studied was the distribution of the samples based on their risk factor. In this case, We can see the distribution of the samples based on their comorbidities in Figures @ref(fig:distribution-by-comorbidities-totals) and @ref(fig:distribution-by-comorbidities):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure @ref(fig:distribution-by-comorbidities) we can see that the majority of the population had no comorbidities (&gt; 99%).\n\n\n\nAnother layer of granularity is the age distribution per lab. This could be helpful if we are trying to include only labs with an age distribution similar to the non-sequenced people. This is shown in Figure @ref(fig:samples-per-lab):\n\n\n\n\n\nAge distribution of samples collected by each lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more way to look at the data is to see how it is distributed over time, regardless of the age of the population. In particular, we can look at the distribution of cases per lineage sequenced, the hospitalisations and deaths\n\n\nWe can also plot the lineage evolution over time. We can do it per week for each variant count in Figure @ref(fig:lineage-over-time-N):\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly total count of lineages sequenced. Only those lineages with 500 records or more in the entire dataset are shown.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to visualize better which variant is taking over and when is to visualize this as a percentage. This is show in Figure @ref(fig:lineage-over-time-perc):\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly percentage of lineages sequenced. Only those lineages with 500 records or more in the entire dataset are shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing we can do is to summarise per month the number of people tested positive, hospitalized and deaths to compare with the sequenced data. The weekly hospitalisations are shown in Figure @ref(fig:biweekly-hospitalisations):\n\n\n\n\n\nBi-weekly percentage of hospitalisation people per sequencing status.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure @ref(fig:biweekly-hospitalisations), it is clear that the proportion of people hospitalised from sequenced people is higher than those from people who are not sequenced. Therefore, a direct estimation from the sequenced data only will estimate a higher hospitalisation rate for each variant studied and therefore it is required to adjust for that bias.\n\n\n\nThe number of deaths per sequencing status is shown in Figure @ref(fig:biweekly-deaths):\n\n\n\n\n\nBi-weekly percentage of deaths by sequenced status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA table summary for variants and reason for sequencing is shown in Table @ref(tab:table-by-variant):\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cases, hospitalisations and death per lineage and reason for sequencing. NAs correspond to the values of not sequenced people.\n\n\nReason for Sequencing\nLineage\nNumber of cases\nNumber of hospitalisations\nNumber of deaths\nNumber of ICUs\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nB.1.1.3\n104\n3\n0\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nB.1.1.7\n1,357\n66\n13\nNA\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nB.1.351\n3,785\n181\n25\nNA\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nB.1.525\n936\n27\n6\nNA\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nB.1.617.1\n472\n31\n0\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nB.1.617.2\n88,407\n4,945\n309\nNA\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBA.1\n40,805\n2,092\n141\nNA\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBA.2\n30,186\n1,488\n63\nNA\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBA.4\n692\n30\n1\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBA.5\n15,939\n873\n23\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBE.1\n486\n16\n0\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBM.1\n203\n13\n0\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nBQ.1\n313\n2\n0\n0\n\n\nCommunity Surveillance\nNA\n875,608\n28,354\n967\nNA\n\n\nICU/HDU/Death\nB.1.351\n124\n58\n15\n124\n\n\nICU/HDU/Death\nB.1.617.2\n492\n247\n87\n492\n\n\nICU/HDU/Death\nBA.5\n121\n77\n11\n121\n\n\nTravel\nB.1.617.2\n1,389\n279\n1\n0\n\n\nTravel\nBA.1\n4,891\n200\n12\n0\n\n\nTravel\nBA.2\n4,637\n235\n1\n0\n\n\nTravel\nBA.4\n194\n10\n0\n0\n\n\nTravel\nBA.5\n3,630\n171\n5\n0\n\n\nTravel\nBE.1\n120\n7\n0\n0\n\n\nTravel\nNA\n101,211\n3,613\n49\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom summary Table @ref(tab:table-by-variant) a weighted average of the hospitalisation and death rate for each variant can be obtained and then compared it to the non-sequenced data. Given that the number of records of the community surveillance is substantially much higher than the rest of the groups, it could be advisable to use only community surveillance data only.\nIt can be seen that some of the records labeled as ICU did not match their hospitalisation flag. Therefore this needs to be corrected in the raw data as well.\n\n\n\nA final check that we are looking at similar data sources can be a comparison between the totals reported during the pandemic and the cases recorded after cleaning the data in this study. This is show in Figure @ref(fig:comparison-with-estijaba):\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cases over time for two different data sources, namely this study and totals reported by Estijaba.\n\n\n\n\nSince the number of sequenced for the delta variant appears to be somehow very large, we can plot the number of cases per variant over time. This is shown in Figure @ref(fig:comparison-with-estijaba-lineages):\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of cases over time for two different data sources, namely this study and totals reported by Estijaba."

    "text": "Firstly, we need to clean the data to ensure that the data is of a good enough quality and no double-counting occurs. In particular we are going to focus on three aspects:\n\nRe-code lineage into relevant variants. In particular:\na. Rename AY.XX into parent lineage Delta B.1.659.2.\nb. Rename all BA.X.X into the parent lineage BA.X (e.g. BA.1.1 is renamed as BA.1).\nc. Rename variant B.1.1.529 as BA.1 as per this description.\nFix records in which age is not defined by retrieving the age from the year of birth from the Emirates ID.\n\n\nRemove invalid records, namely:\na. EIDs that are invalid and do not correspond to any record (5145 records).\nb. Records with lineage labeled as Jul 25 2022 12:00AM (2033 records).\nc. Records with a CollectionDateTime before February 1st, 2020 (6 records).\nRemove duplicate IDs covering the same infection case are present in the database (e.g. two EIDs for the same date labeled the lineage as BA.2 and BA.2.1).\nSelect for the patients sequenced only those whose lineage sequenced have at least more than 500 records.\nCheck also how many records labeled as non-sequenced have a lab assigned according to the dashboard data from ADPHC.\n\nOnce the data is cleaned, we can summarize the number of cases per variant recorded and compare it to the values published by ADPHC.\n\n\nLineages in the dataset appear with multiple names. Some of those lineages were recorded with multiple names. In the original dataset there are 1000 different variants labeled. Some of the reasons for so many sublineages defined registered were\n\nAll sublineages were registered (e.g.: BA.2.40, BA.2.75)\nThe mutation of the sublineage was labeled registered (e.g.: AY.17 (S:D1118Y))\n\nSome sublineages contain a certain description (e.g. BA.2 (Recombinant?))\nSome sublineages are double coded (e.g.: “Delta/B.1.617.2”)\nSome sublineages were wrongly labeled (e.g.: ~2000 records with “Jul 25 2022 12:00AM” as lineage)\n\nTherefore, an aggregation criteria needs to be defined. For the purposes of this report, the following criteria was used:\n\nDescription of mutations were removed (e.g. AY.17 (S:D1118Y) becomes AY.17)\nAll variants were re-defined to their main sub-lineages (e.g.: AY.17 or AY.103 were redefined as B.1.617.2).\nDouble labeling was defined as per the lineage name (e.g.:Delta/B.1.617.2 was coded as B.1.617.2).\nVariant B.1.1.529 was renamed as BA.1.\nAll records with lineage labeled as “Jul 25 2022 12:00AM” were removed.\n\nAfter the re-coding of the lineages in the databases, the number of records for each lineage (for those lineages that contained more than 500 records) is shown in Figure @ref(fig:check-recoded-lineages). It is important to note that this distribution is done with the raw data before removing duplicates in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of records per lineage before removal of duplicates.\n\n\n\n\nOnce lineages have been re-coded and the data cleaned from invalid records, we can move into the removal of duplicates.\n\n\n\nAfter recoding lineages and fixing the records that were considered as invalid, the next step consists of cleaning the data by removing all the duplicates.\nFirstly, We check the number of duplicate IDs appearing in the database. This is shown in ?@tbl-duplicate-ids-check or Table @ref(tab:duplicate-ids-check):\n\n\n\n\nNumber of records per ID number of the 10 most repeated records in the database.\n\n\nPseudoID\n# records\n\n\n\n\n{6BFEAEC8-A945-48B5-B87B-59E8E6F64435}\n340\n\n\n{20A622C3-06CB-4E9D-86E0-0632490450B6}\n144\n\n\n{37D050C7-4927-4AC6-B43E-6631A462EC3D}\n140\n\n\n{B3BA3F02-9D09-42A4-AF4F-8DEC36CE5007}\n140\n\n\n{080D687A-A6E6-4BC1-9098-EE740BEE0EC9}\n120\n\n\n{492A371D-3629-455E-9FE2-8760C6B1783F}\n120\n\n\n{74E26468-4BF9-4503-BAE4-785942560BED}\n120\n\n\n{9DC90E03-1C5A-40F0-8330-3BDD7DE5D57D}\n120\n\n\n{C9EEA6BA-0D32-4BC1-9E4E-5A4E550689DE}\n120\n\n\n{F80A583E-AC85-4C45-9F75-823AD0592E87}\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see in the summary table, there are many patients that are repeated in the records (as many as 340 times).\nFor example, we can see the different labels for a given patient in Table @ref(tab:patient-multiple-records):\n\n\n\n\nDifferent records for the same infection(s) for patient with PseudoID\n\n\nCollectionDateTime\nNationality\nAge\nLineage.Short\nTableau_Travel_Country_Name\nTableau_ICU_Status\nPerforming.Facility\nSequenced\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\nBA.1\nSERBIA\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\nUNKNOWN\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nPure Health\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-25 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n31\n\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n0\n\n\n2021-12-28 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n31\n\nUnknown\n\n\n0\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\nBA.5\nUNKNOWN\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\nBA.5\nUNKNOWN\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n30\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nExpatraite\n31\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n2022-06-12 00:00:00\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\n\nOthers\nPure Health\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore it looks like many patients are registered as repeated cases for the same infection episode.

This means that those patients with travel history unknown and/or travel country name as unknown were considered as non-travelers.\nRegister the first non-empty field for Tableau_ICU_Status.\nRegister the first non-empty field for Performing Facility for sequenced patients (when available).\n\nAfter cleaning the data, we can check how many times a person is repeated in Table @ref(tab:duplicate-ids-cleaned-check).\n\n\n\n\nNumber of records per ID number of the 10 most repeated records in the database.\n\n\nPseudoID\n# records\n\n\n\n\n{92E11469-6664-4C51-B14B-45C1844C6761}\n6\n\n\n{53E1C60B-BDD6-4A59-85D4-3152AF8FE89F}\n5\n\n\n{763E6F05-FA36-4203-B78B-58DB686BEC1E}\n5\n\n\n{8E907F96-5A60-4B8C-97BD-D22B0B7DFBDE}\n5\n\n\n{A5E35727-E930-44CB-A734-10429FAAB9E1}\n5\n\n\n{CDD7B77C-D1AC-43A8-B257-D1EEF6AC6689}\n5\n\n\n{F719CB95-F15C-4EED-8666-46D2030BA2CE}\n5\n\n\n{0461EE2E-5C5A-4188-9821-F625C174D335}\n4\n\n\n{0506B233-B0B9-4E64-B7BC-F61A7396923C}\n4\n\n\n{112090DF-F669-41D9-BB11-381F86D64F6C}\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we can check also if the record of the patient shown in Table @ref(tab:patient-multiple-records) has become the expected record in Table @ref(tab:patient-multiple-records-cleaned):\n\n\n\n\nDifferent records for the same infection(s) for patient with PseudoID\n\n\nCollection.Date\nNationality\nAge\nLineage\nTravel.History\nTableau.ICU.Status\nPerforming.Facility\nSequenced\n\n\n\n\n2021-12-25\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.1\nYes\nOthers\nDanat Al Emarat Hospital\n1\n\n\n2022-06-09\nMOROCCO\n30\nBA.5\nYes\nOthers\nG42 Laboratory\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of lineages after the removal of duplicate records is shown in Figure @ref(fig:remove-duplicate-records-plot):\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of people sequenced per variant after data cleaning.
