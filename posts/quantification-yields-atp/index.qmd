This is a post to explain what was done in the framework to calculate the yields of ATP using first principles..

This code was developed in MATLAB together with its visualizations. 

The online simulation tool is available in [this website](https://envbioprom.shinyapps.io/bioreactor-dashboard/)

The model simulator can be seen in @fig-propionate-pathway.

An interest insight is to plot the methanogenic niche, also known as the range in which both reactions appear to be feasible. The methanogenic niche can be seen in @fig-methanogenic-niche.
